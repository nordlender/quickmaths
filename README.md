# WIP: Quickmaths
A simple and somewhat minimal neovim config for doing maths in LaTeX on the fly. Equipped with snippets and vimtex for fast editing and rendering, it is intended for stirring up and testing small bites of math for how it would look and render, or for writing assignments and the like.

Hopefully, quickmaths can be an entry-point for new vim users into vim for LaTeX.

# To do
As quickmaths is not yet fully finished for use, here is a small to-do list for what remains
- Make CLI-command, qmath or quickmaths to run quickmaths
- Add simple options for fast configuration, such as scrolling wrapped lines, and desired pdf viewer
- Add user defined snippet file
- Add themes
- Add default key bindings, such as CTRL-s for saving
- Make menu for choosing presets (?)
- Set cursor position to be inside of editable portion of file when opening quickmaths (within begin/end document)
- Hide headers, and make it an option to hide or not
- Improve UI (?)
